vulnivore is GitHub issue creator from SARIF data

![Overview](https://github.com/m-mizutani/vulnivore/assets/605953/1d76ac7a-b609-4f12-95ae-4e3930a956bb)

Vulnivore is a tool that translates vulnerability information in SARIF (Static Analysis Results Interchange Format) into GitHub Issues. While GitHub does provide the functionality to upload vulnerability information in SARIF format as CodeQL results, this functionality is only available for private repositories if GitHub Advanced Security is enabled.

However, not all private repositories have access to GitHub Advanced Security. This is where Vulnivore comes in handy. It is designed to convert SARIF results into GitHub Issues, which can then be used for vulnerability management. By doing so, it provides a workaround for repositories that don't have GitHub Advanced Security, allowing them to still manage vulnerabilities effectively.

In a nutshell, Vulnivore is an essential tool for those seeking an alternative way to manage vulnerability information in SARIF format without the need for GitHub Advanced Security.
